# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from Douglas College, and am undergoing further training in Jarvis as a software development engineer, to be matched with a Jarvis client. The software development world is ever-changing, constantly improving and iterating over itself, improving and growing towards more impressive feats. I love being in that current of self-improvement, learning new techniques, skills and methods as technology advances. I enjoy puzzling out software logic of the real world- how systems would have to behave, what alternatives there should be, and how it is all implemented.

      - "Grep App: Deployed a java application emulating 'grep' functionality of bash. Application uses buffered reader/writer and stream API to process files. Application differs from bash grep as it accepts a folder url as source, which will access all files located under that folder for matching, and forces an output file for result of operation. Application can be accessed in target/grep-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar through javac."
